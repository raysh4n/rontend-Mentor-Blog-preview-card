### What I learned
- `max-width:41ch` means can only have 41 characters per line **(excluding the spacing)**
- `background-image`, `background-position` 
- `line-height` value same as it's `height` can causing the text to be vertically centered,
- margin collapse - No double spacing even using `margin-block`
-  The text is centered because the .attribution container spans the full width of its parent element (due to width: 100%;), and the text inside the block element is horizontally centered by default when no text-align property is specified. By default, browsers apply text-align: center to block elements like `<div>` in some scenarios, particularly when there is no overriding text-align specified for that element or its parent.
- Why Use rem?
Scalability:
rem units are relative to the root element's font size (default is 16px in most browsers).
If a user changes the browser's font size for accessibility, rem units adjust automatically, maintaining proportional scaling.
Consistency:

Using rem allows you to create a consistent sizing scale for fonts, paddings, margins, etc., that adapts based on the root size.
Responsive Design:

Itâ€™s easier to make your layout responsive when you define everything in relative units like rem because adjusting the root font size adjusts all rem-based values.
